 ### refactor-to-mvc
 
 This could help me to test the part of code unit testable and Decouple UI and business logic.
 In this code I will be get rid of legacy way of network calls and try to use third-party libraries
 (retrofit, Glide), etc.

![mvc pattern](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/blob/refactor-to-mvc/app/src/main/assets/present_mvc_code_arrangement.png)
 
Feel free to use this code.
I know the code might not be perfect. If you feel I could have improved code better then please give me suggestions!

Thank you!
