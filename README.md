# PetApp-Android
 Exercise to get hands on refactoring apps with architecture.
 I will try to write rough unit-test and instrumentation test aswell part of implementation.
 I won't be following TDD development, instead i will be implementing feature first then I'll write
 testing code, so I may create seperate branches for that aswell.
 
 # Aim
 
 The code in master branch is written in legacy way. Now I'm thinking to re-write the code in following ways.
 
 # refactor-to-mvc
 
 This could help me to test the part of code unit testable and Decouple UI and business logic.
 In this code I will be get rid of legacy way of network calls and try to use third-party libraries
 (retrofit, Glide), etc.
 
 Test related above code can be find in respective branches.
 # refactored-mvc-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test
  
 # refactor-to-mvp
 
  Refactoring the same code in MVP pattern.
 
  Test related above code can be find in respective branches.
 # refactored-mvp-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test

 # refactor-to-mvvm
 
 In this code base I will be using Android Jetpack components and Data Binding features aswell. 
 I have also added better cache management using Room database.
 
Feel free to use this code.
I know the code might not be perfect. If you feel I could have improved code better then please give me suggestions!

Thank you!
