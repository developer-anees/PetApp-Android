# PetApp-Android
**Master branch code is Legacy code**, and it's been roughly **refactored in MVC, MVP and MVVM**.
Main focus is to write some Testing code, feel free to use code if you found it's helpful.
 
 # [refactor-to-mvc branch](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/tree/refactor-to-mvc)
 Legacy code is roughly modified into MVC pattern.
 
 # [refactored-mvc-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/tree/refactored-mvc-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test)
 Implemented tests based on MVC code, after writing unit-test based on the result some logic also has been re-written.
  
 # [refactor-to-mvp](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/tree/refactor-to-mvp)
 Refactored code to MVP pattern.
 
 # [refactored-mvp-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/tree/refactored-mvp-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test)
 Implemented unit-test for testing view(interface).

 # [refactor-to-mvvm](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/tree/refactor-to-mvvm)
 Refactored code to MVVM.
 
 #[refactored-mvvm-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test](https://github.com/developer-anees/PetApp-Android/tree/refactored-mvvm-unit-test-and-instrumentation-test)
 Implemented unit-test for view model.
 

This code is not perfect. Mainly focused on unit-test in various patterns
If you find this code helpful, feel free to use.
